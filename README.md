# House Price Predictions

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project focused on predicting house prices. Using machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights into the factors influencing house prices and create models for predicting house prices based on various features.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-predictions.git
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Navigate to the `house_price_predictions.ipynb` notebook and open it.

## Project Overview

In this Jupyter Notebook project, we perform the following steps:

1. Data Loading: We start by loading the dataset containing information about houses, including features like square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and more, along with their corresponding prices.

2. Data Exploration: We explore the dataset to gain insights into its structure, distribution, and relationships between variables.

3. Data Preprocessing: Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical variables are performed to prepare the data for modeling.

4. Data Splitting: We split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of our predictive models.

5. Model Building: Several machine learning algorithms are employed to build predictive models. We experiment with various techniques to find the best-performing model.

6. Model Evaluation: We evaluate the models using appropriate metrics and visualize the results to make informed decisions about model selection.

7. Conclusion: We summarize the findings and discuss the implications of the house price predictions.
